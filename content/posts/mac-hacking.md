For me, buying a new computer isn't enough to make it truly my own. There are few customizations that I've acquired slowly over the years which help working with the machine a breeze. If we try to add 50 cool new customisations at once, the most likely outcome is that we end up using 1-2 or maybe none of them after that. So what I usually do is to add stuff slowly, when there is an actual necessity and force myself to use it for a week.

These are some tools that have come in handy and are a must have for my personal machine.
