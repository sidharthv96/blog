A full time job takes care of a lot of things for us. Health insurance, tax payments,

The pandemic has transformed the remote work demographics in a way even the Internet couldn't. After working for almost 3 Years in Oracle as a Full time employee, 2 years in office and 1 locked down at home, I decided to take a different path in my Career.

Working at Oracle, one thing was certain, I'll get the salary credit SMS on the last day of every month. The team was amazing, we built a product from scratch, the pay was OK as per Indian standards. When the oppurtunity to work remotely for TurgenSec in London showed up initially, I pushed it out. I didn't want to abandon my team and my project mid way, it felt like my baby. After a year, the baby had grew up, and it felt like I could safely step away. So when Peter persuaded me the second time, I took the leap.

Quitting Oracle was not an easy decision Emotionally, but the belief that the personal bonds I had developed with the people over there would trancend employers helped me.

Financially, quitting a steady job for a startup is always a risk, but I had the stomach for this one. So these are the things to look out for when working as a Contractor.

# Contractor

As long as the company you work for does not have an Indian Entity, the only option to be employed is as a Contractor.
Some companies use services like [Pilot](https://pilot.com/) or [Oysters](https://www.oysterhr.com/) to employ us locally. In that case, a lot of hassles are solved.

# Perks of being self employed

## More Money

Choosing the right company which doesn't discriminate based on where you live is the key. The USD/GBP/EUR to INR conversion does wonders.

## Less Taxes

As a Full time employee, the company cuts the taxes before they pay the salary.
But when self employed, we have pre-tax money to spend.

If your income is <50L, you only have to pay tax on 50% of your income under [section 44ADA](https://www.thegalacticadvisors.com/post/comprehensive-guide-on-tax-for-freelancers).

Landing a higher salary job usually means more taxes, but event then, all business related expenses like Travel, Fuel, Hotel Accomodation, Food, Electronic Gadgets, Car, Rent, etc can be deducted from your Income.

So that's like having a 30% discount on all items.

There is also option for GST refunds, which sweetens the deal.

Ps: This is not Tax Advise, Always talk to your CA for details.

## Freedom

Eventhough Oracle did not have strict timings and I had a great manager, peer pressure and morning meetings will force somewhat of a schedule.

The ability to set our own schedule is underrated. I'm usually more productive in the evening, so I could go on a date in the morning and code at night, a stunt that wouldn't be easy to pull of at a regular job.

# Caveats of Remote work

## Risk

You are on your own, the company could end the contract any time.
There is no guarantee of that SMS at the end of the month. If it's a startup, they could be short of funds, a client can pull out causing major setbacks, shit happens.

You should have the discipline to have an emergency fund, a few months salary saved somewhere safe.

## Compliance

- [Handling International payments](../payment)
- Generating Invoices
- Keeping track of payments
- Filing monthly taxes
- Paying quarterly taxes
- Year end audits
- Keeping Reciepts, Expense reports

Things add up, and it's a bit overwhelming for a newcomer. Having a few sources of support can help. [Remote Indian](remoteindian.com) has helped me beyond imagination. I cannot be thankful enough for the community over there who helped navigate the choppy waters.

A good CA helps, I had to go trough 3 CAs before I finally connected with [Prasad Bhutada](mailto:prasad.bhutada@bnbca.in), another RemoteIndian member.

## Insurance

Get a good Health insurance and a Term insurance if you have dependents.

Selecting one can be a daunting task. The #finance channel in RemoteIndian was a treasure trove of info.

The folks over at [Ditto](https://joinditto.in/) are quite nice.
Some good sources to get started are:

## Credit Cards

Companies might not issue cards for you as you don't have a salary.
Some banks accept Income Tax Returns as proof, some don't.

I did not have this issue as I had taken multiple cards when employed at Oracle.

If you don't have a Credit history, get a credit card against your FD ASAP, a solid credit score and history will help a lot in the long term.

Overall, the change has been a wonderful experience for me, and the friendships still go strong, win-win.
