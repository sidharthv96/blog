So, you just landed your first remote job and is gonna get paid in Dollars, Pounds, Yen or any other Fiat Currency (Doge coin does not apply).
There are multiple ways to get money into India and each has it's own issues. This is a summary of all the options that I evaluated along with very helpful bunch of people at [RemoteIndian](https://remoteindian.com).

# TL;DR - My final setup

- Current account in Axis Bank
- Transfer fund as USD using Wise.com (Do NOT use INR transfer as getting FIRC is close to impossible)
- Zoho Invoice for Book keeping and GST
- A good Chartred Accountant for all queries

# The easy way!

Get a good CA who has experience in this area.

Having a good CA makes our lives much easier and stress free. They'll also advise us on tax planning to boost our savings.

I had to go trough 3 CAs before I finally connected with [Prasad Bhutada](mailto:prasad.bhutada@bnbca.in), another RemoteIndian member. He has in depth knowledge in all the required areas and is extremely helpful with any queries that I have.

# Things the government wants, and how do we get them

- Foreign Inward Remittance Certificate (FIRC)
- 20L+ -> GST Registration and Letter of Undertaking (LUT)
- 50L+ -> Audited Books
- Income Tax (Quarterly Advance Tax, Yearly Filings )
- TDS, If you hire someone under you

## FIRC

As exports are taxed at 0%, FIRC is used to prove that the money was not domestic.

It is a certificate which states the Incoming Currency, Conversion Rate, Reason for Transfer and Remitter details.

It is issued by the Banks which process the conversion to INR.

Getting it can be tricky when using services like Payoneer, Wise, etc. But the workaround is explained at the end.

## GST and LUT

If you landed a juicy paycheck > 20L, you have to get a GST registration. Don't worry, Software exports are rated at 0%
tax, so you don't have to pay any GST. For this, you have to submit a Letter of Undertaking yearly via the portal, simple form, few clicks, no hassle.

Just get registered via the [Official portal](https://gst.gov.in) and file the Monthly GST-1 and GST-3B Forms and annual return.

Services like Zoho Invoice connects to GST portal and makes this easy. Your CA can also do it for you.

## Audits

Once your income crosses 50L, you need to get all the books audited by your CA.

## Income Tax

If your income is Less than 50L, there is a Section 44ADA to save tax on 50% of the amount.

Check out this [ Comprehensive Guide on Tax for Freelancers
](https://www.thegalacticadvisors.com/post/comprehensive-guide-on-tax-for-freelancers), written by people who know this much better than I do.

## TDS

If you are hiring someone, you will have to deduct 10% from their salary and pay it as Tax Deducted at Source.
You'll need to apply for a [TAN number](https://www.tin-nsdl.com/services/tan/tan-introduction.html).

# Things we want, and how do we get them

- Minimal hassle with Government
- Maximum profit ;)
- Peace of mind

# Setting up an International payment pipeline

## Choosing a Bank

This usually depends on your personal preference and relationship with them.
You will need to open a Current Account as the Forex rates are better compared to a regular Savings account. Some banks also mandate a Current Account if you do a good amount of transactions.
There are a few points to note when selecting a bank.

### Forex Rates.

Always negotiate with the bank for better rates with respect to IBR/MMR (Inter Bank Rate/Mid Market Rate - The rate you see on google) and not Card rate (The rate bank offers to regular customers).

They usually offer 40p below IBR if the amount is around $5000USD. But based on your relationship manager and branch, it can go down to 25-30p, or even less if you're lucky.

### Customer support

Having a good relationship manager will be very helpful down the road.

Stick with one of the big private banks, ICICI, HDFC, Axis, etc.

The service quality is mainly dependent on the branch and not the bank, so ask around with your friends.

### Type of account

Opening an Exchange Earners Foreign Currency (EEFC) Account will help when dealing with Forex.

A regular current account will also suffice if the volume is low.

## Choosing a Payment Processor

If your client can do a Direct deposit in USD using SWIFT, you can skip this section as that's the best choice.

For the rest of us, there are some companies that offer international transfer.

All of you might have heard of Paypal and Stripe. If you don't love having money in your pocket, go for Paypal. The cut that paypal took, including the FOREX differnce came to around 11% of my First transaction.
Stripe charges around 3-4% + 2% conversion charges, reasonable for an e-Commerce site having hundreds of customers, not so great for a freelancer having one or two clients.

Two better options for getting paid are Payoneer and Wise.

### Payoneer

Payoneer is staightforward, you'll get multiple recieving accounts in different currencies, all your client has to do is a local transfer to that account. Payoneer will take a 2% cut and deposit converted INR to your account.

They used to issue e-FIRCs automatically, but some people are reporting issues with that system for a few months now.

If you have an EEFC account, the customer care can link it and you can get the Foreign Currency directly into your account. So the FIRC issue won't be applicable.

Their customer support is reported as sub par, and the website is also not that great.

### Wise.com (Formerly TrasferWise)

A truly modern service, cheap (~0.4% fees!) and has good support. You don't have to create an account, only share your Account Number and SWIFT code.

The only issue I had was that it was impossible to get FIRC issued when the amount was converted to INR.

But thanks to a Friend from Remote Indian community, I found out that we can send USD directly to the account via SWIFT network with an extra charge of around $4.

So I tried this out and it worked seamlessly! Now my bank will issue the FIRC as they are doing the conversion.

Until Revolut comes to India with their borderless account, this seems like the best choice.
